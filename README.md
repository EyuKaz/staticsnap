## What is StaticSnap? 🤔  
StaticSnap is the **lazy developer’s dream plugin** for WordPress. It automatically converts your dynamic posts and pages into static HTML files. Why? Because your server deserves a break, and your visitors deserve lightning-fast load times. ⚡  

Think of it as **WordPress on a diet**—no more bloated database queries, no more PHP processing, just pure, unadulterated HTML. 🥗  

---

## How Does It Work? 🛠️  
1. **You Write Stuff**: You create or update a post/page in WordPress.  
2. **StaticSnap Watches**: Like a creepy but helpful neighbor, it notices. 👀  
3. **Magic Happens**: It generates a static HTML file and saves it in `/wp-content/static/`.  
4. **Boom!**: When someone visits your site, they get served the static file instead of hitting the database. 🎉

## Why Use StaticSnap? 🏆  
- **Speed**: Your site will load faster than a caffeinated cheetah. 🐆☕  
- **Security**: Hackers can’t break what doesn’t exist (no PHP = no vulnerabilities). 🔒  
- **Simplicity**: No settings, no fuss, just install and forget. Set it and forget it, like a crockpot. 🍲  
- **Eco-Friendly**: Uses less server resources, saving the planet one static file at a time. 🌍

## Usage 🎮  

### Automatic Static Generation  
StaticSnap works **automagically**! 🪄  
- Create or update a post/page → Static HTML is generated.  
- Trash a post → Static HTML is deleted.  

### Manual Regeneration  
Want to regenerate all static files? Use **WP-CLI**:  
```bash  
wp staticsnap generate  
```  
This will rebuild all static files faster than you can say, “Why didn’t I do this sooner?”  

### Exclude Posts/Pages  
Don’t want a specific post to be static? Add this to your theme’s `functions.php`:  
```php  
add_post_meta($post_id, '_staticsnap_excluded', true);  
```  
Or use a filter to exclude posts with a specific tag:  
```php  
add_filter('staticsnap_skip_post', function($skip, $post_id) {  
    if (has_tag('no-static', $post_id)) {  
        return true;  
    }  
    return $skip;  
}, 10, 2);  
```

## How It Works Under the Hood 🕵️  

### The Lifecycle of a Static File  
1. **Post Saved**: StaticSnap listens for the `save_post` hook.  
2. **HTML Rendered**: It simulates a frontend request to generate the HTML.  
3. **File Saved**: The HTML is saved to `/wp-content/static/[post-slug].html`.  
4. **Request Served**: When someone visits the post, StaticSnap serves the static file instead of hitting the database.  

### Rewrite Rules  
StaticSnap adds rules to your `.htaccess` (or NGINX config) to serve static files. If the file doesn’t exist, it falls back to WordPress.

## FAQ ❓  

### Q: Will this break my site?  
**A**: Only if you use it wrong. But seriously, test it on a staging site first.  

### Q: Can I use this with caching plugins?  
**A**: Sure, but why? StaticSnap is already faster than your ex’s new relationship.  

### Q: What if I delete the plugin?  
**A**: Your static files will still exist, but they won’t be served. Clean up by deleting `/wp-content/static/`.
